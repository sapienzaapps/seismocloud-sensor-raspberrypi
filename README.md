# Raspberry Pi SeismoCloud client

**Important**: this code is incomplete.

## To Do list:

* [ ] Check for updates at startup
* [ ] Test update procedure
* [ ] Add support for new local discovery protocol
* [ ] Add support for sensor data stream
* [ ] Add support for set probe speed command
* [ ] Add support for statistics publish (WiFI SSID, RSSI, etc)
* [ ] Implement new threshold algorithm (see NodeMCU code)
* [ ] Handle errors
* [ ] Make the sensor/seismometer (platform-agnostic) similar to the NodeMCU/Android one (e.g. rename variables,
refactor control flow, etc)
